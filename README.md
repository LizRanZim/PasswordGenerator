The name of the application is PasswordGenerator

The application is a password generator that asks the user if they want a password with special characters, upper case characters, lower case characters, or numeric characters, and how many characters they want the password to contain.

## Mockup

The following animated .gif shows the application's appearance and functionality on a desktop.
